description: What gmux is and why it exists.

gmux is a browser-based session manager for AI agents, test runners, and long-running processes. It gives you a live sidebar of everything running across a machine, so you can notice what needs attention without cycling through terminal tabs.

## Why it exists

Long-running command-line work is easy to start and annoying to supervise. AI agents, watchers, builds, and shells end up buried in tabs or tmux panes. gmux makes them visible from a browser.

## What it does

- Launches commands as managed sessions through `gmuxr`
- Groups sessions by project directory in a sidebar
- Shows live status: working (cyan dot) or needs attention (amber dot)
- Provides a full interactive terminal in the browser via xterm.js
- Uses adapters to extract tool-specific status (e.g. pi's thinking/waiting states)
- Supports resumable sessions for tools with file-backed state

## Core concepts

### Sessions

A session is any command launched through `gmuxr`:

```bash
gmuxr pi
gmuxr -- make build
gmuxr -- pytest --watch
```

Each session gets a PTY, a WebSocket server, and an adapter for status extraction.

### Adapters

Adapters teach gmux how to interpret specific tools:

- **shell** — terminal title tracking (default fallback)
- **pi** — live status detection, file-backed titles, and session resume

See [Adapters](/adapters) for details.

### Architecture

```
gmuxr (per session) → gmuxd (per machine) → browser
```

- **gmuxr** owns the child process and its live state
- **gmuxd** discovers sessions, proxies connections, and serves the web UI
- **Browser** renders the sidebar and attaches to terminals

See [Architecture](/architecture) for the full picture.
