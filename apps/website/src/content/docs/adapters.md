description: How gmux understands what your process is doing.
---

Adapters teach gmux how to interpret specific tools. When you launch a session, gmux automatically detects what you're running and activates the right adapter.

This page is the high-level overview. For implementation details, see [Writing an Adapter](/develop/writing-adapters). For the runtime model behind `gmuxr`, `gmuxd`, session files, and resume, see [Adapter Architecture](/develop/adapter-architecture).

## What adapters do

An adapter watches the terminal output of your process and reports structured status to the sidebar:

- **Active** — the tool is working (green pulsing dot)
- **Attention** — the tool needs your input (orange dot)
- **Error** — something went wrong (red dot)

Without an adapter, gmux still tracks whether the process is alive — but with one, you get meaningful at-a-glance status.

## Automatic detection

You don't configure adapters. gmux recognizes tools by their command name:

```bash
gmuxr pi            # → pi adapter (spinner detection, session resume)
gmuxr bash          # → shell adapter (terminal title tracking)
gmuxr -- make build # → shell adapter
```

If no specific adapter matches, the **shell** adapter takes over. It tracks terminal title changes so your shell's working directory appears in the sidebar, but it doesn't report rich activity status.

## Beyond status: session files

Some adapters understand more than just terminal output. The **pi** adapter knows where pi stores its session files, how to extract conversation titles from them, and how to resume previous sessions. This means:

- Resumable sessions appear in the sidebar even when nothing is running
- Session titles show the first message you sent, not just `pi`
- Renaming a session with `/name` updates the sidebar in real time

See [Integrations → pi](/integrations/pi) for the concrete behavior.

## Self-reporting

Any process can report its own status without a custom adapter. `gmuxr` sets `$GMUX_SOCKET` in the child's environment:

```bash
curl -X PUT --unix-socket "$GMUX_SOCKET" \
  http://localhost/status \
  -d '{"label": "building", "state": "active"}'
```

Self-reported status takes priority over adapter-detected status. This lets tools integrate with gmux directly, without changes to gmux itself.
