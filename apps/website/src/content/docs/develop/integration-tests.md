title: Integration Tests
description: End-to-end tests that launch real tools through gmuxd.
---

Integration tests verify the full pipeline — from launching a real tool through gmuxd to observing session state transitions, file attribution, title derivation, and resume. They catch issues that unit tests can't: timing between inotify and file writes, TUI input handling, trust prompts, and adapter attribution against real session files.

## Running

```bash
# Build first — tests use the compiled binaries
./scripts/build.sh

# All integration tests
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 300s ./packages/adapter/adapters/

# One adapter
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 120s -run TestPi ./packages/adapter/adapters/

# One test
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 120s -run TestPiTurnAndTitle ./packages/adapter/adapters/
```

Tests are gated by the `integration` build tag — `go test ./...` never runs them. Each adapter's tests also skip automatically if the required binary isn't on `PATH`.

:::caution[API costs]
These tests make real API calls. A full run costs roughly $0.01–0.05 depending on model response length. Don't run them in a tight loop.

## What's tested

Each adapter has a consistent set of tests:

| Test | Verifies |
|------|----------|
| `TurnAndTitle` | Send a message → file attribution → title from first user message → resume key set |
| `SecondTurnKeepsTitle` | Send two messages → title stays as first message |
| `Resumability` | Send message → kill → session becomes resumable → resume → alive again with same title |
| `NameOverridesTitle` (pi only) | Use `/name` command → title updates to explicit name |

Shell has a single `WSInput` smoke test that verifies the WebSocket → PTY input pipeline.

## Test harness

Tests use a shared harness in `packages/adapter/adapters/testutil/`. The key components:

### `StartGmuxd(t)`

Launches an isolated gmuxd instance:
- Random port (no conflicts with dev or other tests)
- Temp socket directory
- Empty `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (no tailscale, no user config)
- `PATH` includes the built `gmux` binary from `bin/` (for example `bin/gmux` on Unix or `bin/gmux.exe` on Windows)
- Cleaned up automatically when the test ends

### `ConnectSession(sessionID)`

Opens a WebSocket directly to the runner's Unix socket (bypassing gmuxd's WS proxy). Sends an initial resize message so TUI apps render properly. Returns a `send` function for typing into the terminal.

### Polling helpers

| Helper | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `WaitForSession(id, pred, timeout)` | Polls `GET /v1/sessions` until the predicate matches |
| `WaitForOutput(sessionID, timeout)` | Polls scrollback until the TUI has rendered |
| `WaitForScrollback(socketPath, substr, timeout)` | Polls scrollback for a specific string |

## Writing a test for a new adapter

Follow the pattern in the existing test files:

```go
//go:build integration

package adapters

func TestMyAppTurnAndTitle(t *testing.T) {
    testutil.RequireBinary(t, "myapp")

    g := testutil.StartGmuxd(t)
    cwd := t.TempDir()

    sess := g.Launch([]string{"myapp"}, cwd)
    send, _ := g.ConnectSession(sess.ID)
    g.WaitForOutput(sess.ID, 15*time.Second)

    // Handle any trust/setup prompts your tool shows.
    // send("\r")

    // Send input and wait for the tool to process it.
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    send("say hi\r")

    // Wait for file attribution.
    g.WaitForSession(sess.ID, func(s testutil.Session) bool {
        return s.ResumeKey != ""
    }, 60*time.Second, "file attribution")

    // Verify title.
    updated := g.WaitForSession(sess.ID, func(s testutil.Session) bool {
        return s.Title != "" && s.Title != "myapp"
    }, 15*time.Second, "title")
    t.Logf("title=%q", updated.Title)
}
```

### Things to watch for

- **Trust prompts.** Claude Code and Codex both ask "do you trust this directory?" on first launch in a new workspace. Dismiss them by waiting for `"trust"` in the scrollback, then sending `\r`.
- **TUI readiness.** Ink-based TUIs (pi, codex) need a moment after rendering before they accept input. A 2-second sleep after `WaitForOutput` is usually enough.
- **Batch file writes.** Some tools write user + assistant messages in one batch after the turn completes (pi does this). You can't reliably observe transient `working=true` status via polling — wait for the final state instead.
- **Shared session directories.** Codex uses date-based directories shared across all sessions. Old files from previous test runs may be present. The adapter's `AttributeFile` handles this, but expect attribution-rejection log lines for stale files.
